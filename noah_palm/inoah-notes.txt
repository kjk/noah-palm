## Upgrading the database from 0.5 to 1.0 format

Need only happen once. reg_codes table wasn't used in 0.5 and its format changed.

Previous format:

New format:
CREATE TABLE reg_codes
(
  reg_code      VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  purpose       VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  when_entered  TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  disabled_p    CHAR(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'f',  -- is this reg code disabled (e.g. because we decided people shared it)

  PRIMARY KEY (reg_code)
);

Upgrade commands:

drop table reg_codes;

CREATE TABLE reg_codes
(
  reg_code      VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  purpose       VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  when_entered  TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  disabled_p    CHAR(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'f',  -- is this reg code disabled (e.g. because we decided people shared it)

  PRIMARY KEY (reg_code)
);
