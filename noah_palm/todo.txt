bug:
> Thank you for the reply.  I did a little more investigation after I

> 
> The PPrs file is created by Palm Reader Pro v.2.2.2.  The conflict with
> Noah occurs when an ebook is stored on the memory stick.  The PPrs
> appears to be a bookmark file that is created when a book is opened and
> then closed.  The work around that I have found is to store all ebooks
> on internal memory instead of the memory stick.

> Perhaps you can come up with a better solution on the next release of
