* bring Noah Pro to using only vfs/mem
* figure out the "wordHistory" business in thes.c
* "Timo Laitinen" <timolai@utu.fi> can beta-test MemPlug version (e-mail 4 Nov
2002)
* make Noah Lite compile
* change the way we iterate over dbs
* save which db is used in preferences
* split globals into common globals and per-thing globals

We have:
- abstracted acess to files (either vfs or internal memory db api), it mimics the internal db api. vfs implementation adds caching of records in internal memory
- abstracted dictionary access api i.e. have the same api regardless of what kind of dictionary we access (thesarus, noah lite, noah pro etc.). It uses the abstracted access to files

* [DONE 2002/10/07] make thesaurus compile


file api:
  vfs implementation
  internal memory db implementation
