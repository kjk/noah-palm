Simple data format

Record 0:
  0  4 long wordsCount
  4  2 int  wordsRecsCount   - number of records with compressed words
  6  2 int  defsLenRecsCount - number of records with lengths of definitions
  8  2 int  defsRecsCount    - number of records with definitions
 10  2 int  maxWordLen
 12  2 int  maxDefLen
 14  2 int  hasPosInfoP
 16  2 int  posRecsCount

Record 1:
  record with word cache
  cache entries = recordSize/sizeof(WordCacheEntry)=recordSize/8
WordCacheEntry:
  0 4 ulong  word number
  4 2 uint   record number
  6 2 uint   offset in the record

Record 2:
  record with compression data (for words)

Record 3:
  record with compression data (for definition)

Record 4:
  first record with words

Record 4 + wordsRecsCount:
  first record with def lens

Record 4 + wordsRecsCount + defsLenRecsCount:
  first rec with definitions

Record 4 + wordsRecsCount + defsLenRecsCount + defsRecsCount:
  first rec with pos info

Structure of the record with compression data (for words and definitions):
  0  2                   int     maxComprStrLen
  2  2+2*maxComprStrLen  int[]   number of coded strings of a given length (1..maxComprStrLen)
  .. ..                  char[]  compressed strings, starting with those of length 1
